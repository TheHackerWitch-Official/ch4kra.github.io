<p>Hi, I’m The Hacker Witch! I’m a fifth-year student at Western Governor’s University (previously UCF, go Knights!). I work as a Strategic Advisory Intern at CrowdStrike, and help with Red Team engagements as much as possible.</p>

<p>Cyber security has always fascinated me, but certain parts of it have always felt arcane (I’m looking at you RE). I created this site to be a compendium of ethical hacking knowledge because I believe that knowledge should be free. I am still figuring out where I belong in the infosec community, so I have tons to learn!</p>

<p>If learning about infosec alongside a witchy, hacker gal sounds like something you’re into, then you might like it here! Welcome to The Hacker Witch.</p>
