Hi, I'm The Hacker Witch! I'm a fifth-year student at Western Governor's University (previously UCF, go Knights!). I work as a Strategic Advisory Intern at CrowdStrike, and help with Red Team engagements as much as possible. I've been studying information security topics for about two years, but just recently started studying for certifications.

Cybersecurity has always fascinated me, but certain parts of it have always felt arcane (I'm looking at you RE). I created this site to be a compendium of ethical hacking knowledge because I believe knowledge should be free. I am still figuring out where I belong in the infosec community, so I have tons to learn! 

If learning about infosec alongside a witchy, hacker gal sounds like something you're into, then you might like it here! Welcome to The Hacker Witch.
